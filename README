dateinput
=========

simple helper for browsers which don't support input type=date


usage

you can also invoke for elements you create programatically:
  dateinput(myElement);
  dateinput(myElement, new Date());
  
  
features
--------

this is just a very basic date picker allowing you to assume input type=date is supported.
- allows picking a blank value
- fires change events on the initial element
- no dependencies, no fluff
